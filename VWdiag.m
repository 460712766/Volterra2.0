% function kdiag=VWdiag(xn, yn, ord, os, R, delay, varargin)
% Is a wrapper function to easily call a kernel diagonal identification of 
% order from 2 to 5.
% The input parameters are passed to the function WVdiagN of order N.
% See VWdiagN functions help for details.
% varagin should contain the list of lower order prevously identified Wiener
% kernels, e.g.:
% varargin={k0,k2,... k2n} or varargin={k1, .. k(2n+1)} where order 
% N=2,3,4,5 and N=2n or N=2n+1

function kdiag=VWdiag(xn,yn,ord,os,R,A,delay,varargin)
