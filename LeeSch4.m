%function [k4]=LeeSch4(xn, yn, os, R, A, swap, delay)
%
% k4 is the fourth order kernel of Wiener series according to Lee-Schetzen 
% method, which will contain not-a-NaN values ony within the set of 
% fundamental points,  which is the minimum set of non-diagonal points which 
% allows the reconstruction of non-diagonal kernel points by symmetry 
% (see symmetrize function).
% For diagonal points refer to WVdiag4 function.
%
% xn is the input sequence.
%
% yn the output sequence.
%
% os is the input/output sequences index from where the cross-correlation is 
% started, all the sequence values before os are thrown. In can be used when 
% xn and yn have been obtained from an A/D conversion and we the initial 
% transient conditions cut away.
%
% R is the length corresponding to length(k4)-1. The lags domain interval 
% corresponding to k4 is [0,R]x[0,R]x[0,R]x[0,R].
%
% A is the second order moment of xn (i.e. power).
%
% swap is an optional parameter for speed optimization 
% (see fastxcorr for insights), it depends on the machine you're on, and 
% on having compiled this code or not. 
% If you don't know what to do use default value. 
% (We choose 23 in octave environment and 11 in the standalone version)
%
% delay gives the result restricted to the lags domain interval
% [0+delay,R]x[0+delay,R]x[0+delay,R]x[0+delay,R],
% most useful for higher order kernels.
