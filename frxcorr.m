%function [R, lags] = frxcorr (X, Y, N, maxlag, method, swap)
%
% frxcorr (fast-real xcorr) it's an alternate function to Matlab's and 
% Octave's xcorr, restricted to real column vectors of equal length case 
% and for causal part of cross-correlation system identification 
% (in Wiener sense), created to be Matlab and Octave compatible.
% The main motivation for frxcorr is speed, for real vectors correlation case,
% traded for the generality and versatility of xcorr. 
% The attempt made within this modification was to trade the general purpose 
% characteristics of the original xcorr for a more efficient memory use and 
% speed: note that, within this context, the Wiener identification process may
% involve very long input/output (real valued) sequences and a huge number of 
% calls to this frxcorr function, so the computing time saving using this
% function can be considerable with respecct to the use of xcorr.
% Error check is at a minimum (in fact no parameter check is made at all), 
% so please take care to following strictly the calling convention instructions
% we advice hereafter.
% Usage:
%
% X and Y, have to be the column vectors (with length N > 1) corresponding
% to the vectors being correlated;
%
% N, have to be the length of X and Y;
%
% maxlag, it's the length of the resulting correlation sequence (i.e. R vector) 
% minus 1 and the R vector will represent the rightmost side of the 
% crosscorrelation sequence (the only part needed in case of causality 
% assumption) with x-axis interval being [0,maxlag] (i.e. the lags output 
% vector).
%
% method, has to be one of the following integers:
%   0, corresponding to 'biased'   for correlation=raw/N, 
%   1, corresponding to 'unbiased' for correlation=raw/(N-|lag|), 
%   2, corresponding to 'coeff'    for correlation=raw/(correlation value 
%   at lag 0),
%   >=3, <0, corresponding to 'none'  for raw correlation
%
% swap, it's a positive integer (use 10 if you don't know what to do) 
% which swaps between two versions of the cross-correlation algorhytm, 
% an FFT version if X and Y length it's greater than or equal to swap value 
% or a plain non FFT version (brute force) for sequences with length less than 
% swap. The swap parameter has to be assessed eurhystically, and the efficiency
% improvement gained with its use should be assessed on a cpu architecture 
% (or whole system) basis, also depending on the choice of using a compiled 
% version of this function or not. You can use the swaptest utility
% as reference script in the demo directory of WVItools.
%
% NOTE: Cxy=rxcorr(x,y...) corresponds to the estimation of causal part (m>=0)
% of E[x(n)y*(n+m)]=E[x(n-m)y*(n)], which corresponds to estimation of an 
% impulse response h(m) of a causal linear system with input x and output y
