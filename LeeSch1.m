% function [k1]=LeeSch1(xn, yn, os, R, A, swap, delay)
%
% k1 is the first order kernel of Wiener series according to Lee-Schetzen 
% method.
%
% xn is the input sequence
%
% yn the output sequence.
%
% os is the input/output sequences index from where the cross-correlation is 
% started, all the sequence values before os are thrown. In can be used when 
% xn and yn have been obtained from an A/D conversion and we the initial 
% transient conditions cut away.
%
% R is the length corresponding to length(k1)-1. The lags domain interval 
% corresponding to k1 is [0,R].
%
% A is the second order moment of xn (i.e. power).
%
% swap it's an optional parameter for speed optimization 
% (see fastxcorr for insights), it depends on the machine you're on, 
% and on having compiled this code or not. 
% If you don't know what to do use default value. 
% (We choose 23 in octave environment and 11 in the standalone version)
%
% delay gives the result restricted to the lags domain interval [0+delay,R],
% most useful for higher order kernels.
