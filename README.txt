tool:

ident_volt.m      :Identification of Wiener system with algorithm proposed in 

Simone Orcioni, Massimiliano Pirani, and Claudio Turchetti. Advances in
Lee-Schetzen method for Volterra filter identification. Multidimensional
Systems and Signal Processing, 16(3):265-284, 2005.

ident_volt_20.m  :Identification of Wiener system with the algorithm proposed in

Simone Orcioni. Improving the approximation ability of Volterra series identified with a cross-correlation method. Nonlinear Dynamics, 2014.


Wiener2Volterra_20.m : new formulas for Wiener to Volterra conversion.

In the directory examples you can find the code used in the Nonlinear Dynamics paper to obtain the published results.
